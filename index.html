                          can reach speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) in some areas. The technology 
                          uses fiber-optic cable, which amazingly can send data as fast as about 70% the 
                          speed of light.test how much bandwidth you need for your home Wi-Fi network.

                            Fiber optic internet works by splitting files like movies and games into data 
                            packets of zeroes and ones. A laser flashes this Morse code-type signal into
                            one end of a plastic or glass filament. The “wire” is about as thick as one 
                            strand of human hair. A special sheath called a cladding keeps the beam of 
                            ight inside the filament. It bounces off the walls for as far as 60 miles and 
                            pops out the other end where a modem decodes the light into a form your computer
                            can use. Why is fiber optic cable internet so much better than plain ol’ cable 
                            internet? Because there’s no copper wire to gum up the works. Cable internet sends 
                            its signals down metal wires. The metal heats up, weakening the signal and picking 
                            up interference. That’s why cable and DSL internet are so much slower and clumsier 
                            than fiber optics. Fiber to the home (FTTH) is the use of fiber optic cable to directly 
                            connect to customer homes or premises. FTTH provides an end-to-end fiber optic connection, 
                            meaning the transmission of voice, video, and data traffic does not utilize copper wireline infrastructure

                        A wireless internet service provider (WISP) is an internet service provider (ISP) 
                        that allows subscribers to connect to the internet at designated hot spots or access 
                        points using a wireless connection such as Wi-Fi.
                        This type of ISP offers broadband service and allows subscriber computers and other devices, 
                        called stations, to access the internet and the web from anywhere within the service's coverage area. 
                        This is usually a region with a radius of several kilometers.One of the most influential communication 
                        models, peer-to-peer communication, or P2P communication, refers to a decentralized approach of networking 
                        where two end devices (peers) interact directly with each other. Both peers exchange information with each 
                        other without the need for any intermediate servers.
                        Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks 
                        or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the network. This forms 
                        a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

                        For homes with no existing full fibre connection, the required engineer visit itself should not take 
                        more than a couple of hours. The main delay will be waiting for a free time slot for the work to be done. 
                        The whole process should take less than an hour for homes that already have a full-fibre connection.
                        If you have an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) like this on the outside of your location, your connection is 
                        fiber-optic. If you have a Network Interface Device (NID) box like one of these on the outside of your location, 
                        your connection is copper and allows subscriber computers and other devices.
